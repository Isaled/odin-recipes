    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 and 1/3 cups (320ml) warm water (between 100-110°F, 38-43°C)</li>
        <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons (7g) Platinum Yeast from Red Star instant yeast (1 standard packet)*</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon (13g) granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, plus more for pan and brushing on dough</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
       <li>3 and 1/2 cups (about 450g) unbleached all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled), plus more for hands and surface</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the warm water, yeast, and granulated sugar together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted with a dough hook or paddle attachment. Cover and allow to rest for 5 minutes..</li>
        <li>Add the olive oil, salt, and flour. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough: Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for an additional 5 full minutes, or knead by hand on a lightly floured surface for 5 full minutes.</li>
        <li>Rise: Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray—just use the same bowl you used for the dough. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (246°C). Allow it to heat for at least 15-20 minutes as you shape the pizza.</li>
        <li>SWhen the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the dough in half. (If not making 2 pizzas, freeze half of the dough for another time.) Once shaped into a 12-inch circle, lift the edge of the dough up to create a lip around the edges</li>
        <li>Top & bake the pizza: Using your fingers, push dents into the surface of the dough to prevent bubbling. To prevent the filling from making your pizza crust soggy, brush the top lightly with olive oil. Top with your favorite toppings and bake for 13-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
